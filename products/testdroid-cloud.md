[Testdroid Cloud](https://cloud.testdroid.com/) provides the largest device farm of real mobile devices, gathered from different regions globally, including the most versatile OS, OEM and hardware configurations for Android and iOS developers. Testdroid Cloud provides a test automation, remote manual access and REST API to access, run and manage any tests with these devices.

Testdroid Cloud is a mobile app, game and web testing service that enables developers to run their tests on real, physical Android and iOS devices that are all hosted on our secure premises. These devices are hosted in three different locations - Wroclaw, Poland, Mountain View, CA and Oulu, Finland - and are monitored and maintained 24 hours per business day. Our up-time is over 99% and sophisticated monitoring system keeps our devices running at the same rate.

Testdroid Cloud allows users to upload their own tests or use built-in, script-free compatibility tests and crawlers. Devices can be used in parallel with test automation frameworks. For remote manual access only one device can be used at time.

Testdroid Cloud provides support for native, hybrid and web apps on Android and iOS devices and browsers. Any applications created on PhoneGap, Titanium, Unity or some other framework are fully supported at Testdroid Cloud devices.
