---

Appium testing supports writing tests in multiple programming
languages, including Java. Testing can be done against native or
hybrid apps or responsive web pages on both iOS and Android
devices. Only the test setups differ.

For a guide on how to get started with remote Appium testing using
Java, check out [our
tutorial](https://github.com/bitbar/testdroid-samples/tree/master/appium/sample-scripts/java)
on Github.

An interesting blog post on various Appium test setup configurations
with desired capabilities, can be found
