title: Appium Python App Testing
---


So far you should have the necessary environment set up. The
prerequisite documentation for running Appium tests with Python can be
found at [Appium
Prerequisite]({{ site.baseurl }}/appium/python).

You'll find information here how to run your Appium tests against your
native, hybrid or web-applications. Most of the documentation here
below refers to our
[Github](https://github.com/bitbar/testdroid-samples) repos that
contain step by step guides and sample scripts to get you started.

If you have any feedback on how to improve these guides, please leave
us a note at <feedback@bitbar.com> so we can improve these.

# Getting Started

Clone to your local machine the sample Python scripts from our repository.

```shell
$ git clone https://github.com/bitbar/testdroid-samples
```

You now have all necessary examples for starting testing of native,
hybrid or web applications. The example scripts are found under:

```shell
$ cd appium/sample-scripts/python/
```

The content of the files and how to use them is described in the
Github repo page. Let's continue this guide
[there](https://github.com/bitbar/testdroid-samples).
