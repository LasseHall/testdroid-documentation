Testdroid Cloud enables its users to create a specific device groups
that are used to point out on which devices tests are executed. The
device group configuration can be found under the main menu - **Device
Groups**.

Creation of a device group starts by giving a name for device
group. After this, user needs to select either to be created device
group is Android or iOS. Note that device groups can include devices
from either platform, not both. By clicking **Create group** the
device group will be created.

Users can include devices in device groups by selecting device
separately on the left-hand side's browsing menu. After selection,
user can drag and drop devices to newly created device group on the
right-hand side.  The filter options on the left-hand side, for
example, OS versions, API levels, CPUs and so on can be used to browse
specific devices for selection.

The other alternative for creating device groups is to select all
desired devices on the left-hand side widget and clicking '+' on top
of that widget. User can then configure more specific details -
e.g. name - on the right-hand side widget.

The third way to configure device groups is enabled by clicking
existing device group on the right-hand side widget. Devices included
in the specific group will be shown and user can remove and add
devices accordingly.
